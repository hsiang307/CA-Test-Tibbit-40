declare function tbt40_init(use_ssi as no_yes) as tbt40_errcheck
'Call this function to initialize the Tibbit.
'Use_ssi argument specifies whether you want to communicate with this Tibbit using the SSI channel running in the I2C mode (YES), or
'go for direct I/O manipulation a.k.a. bit-banging (NO).
'Note that there is a limited number of SSI channels so if you set use_ssi=YES this function may return TBT40_NO_SSI_AVAILABLE, meaning that
'there are no free SSI channels left. This doesn't mean failure. Rather, it means that comms will proceed in bit banging mood.
'Other error code (TBT40_SELFTEST_FAILED) indicates failure.

declare sub tbt40_set_ohm(impedance as dword, range as dword, save_to_eeprom as no_yes)
'Sets the digital potentiometer to the "impedance" value expressed in Ohms.This value will be rounded to the nearest LOWER potentiometer step and
'limited by the maximum value range achievable on the current IC. The range argument must correctly specify the maximum IC range in Ohms (i.e. set it to
'10000 for 10K IC). You can set the range to the ACTUAL value measured on your IC sample. This will allow for a more precise impedance programming.
'Note that the impedance argument specifies the impedance between I/O lines 3 and 4 of this Tibbit. The impedance between
'terminals 2 and 3 will be in reverse, i.e. 10K - impedance for the 10K IC. Save_to_eeprom argument specifies whether the new impedance value will
'be saved into the EEPROM (and thus persist even after the IC is power-cycled).

declare sub tbt40_set(level as word, save_to_eeprom as no_yes)
'Sets the digital potentiometer to the level (step) in the 0-256 range (there are 257 steps in total). Each step is equal to 1/257th of the IC's range
'(5K, 10K, 50K, or 100K depending on the IC type). Step=0 indicates a near-zero impedance between the I/O lines 3 and 4 of this Tibbit.
'At the same time, the impedance between I/O lines 2 and 3 will be at maximum.
'Save_to_eeprom argument specifies whether the new impedance value will be saved into the EEPROM (and thus persist even after the IC is power-cycled).
